# Single File Django Project
 A minimal Django project encapsulated within a single Python file, demonstrating the basics of configuring settings, defining views, and routing URLs. This example includes a basic view that displays a “Hello World!” message with a dynamically generated SECRET_KEY and another view that evaluates a simple arithmetic expression.
