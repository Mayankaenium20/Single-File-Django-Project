# Single File Django Project
This repository contains a minimal Django project encapsulated within a single Python file. The project demonstrates the basics of configuring Django settings, defining views, and routing URLs without the typical Django project structure.

## Features

- Single file configuration for simplicity and quick setup.
- Two example views:
  - **Index View**: Displays a "Hello World!" message along with a dynamically generated `SECRET_KEY`.
  - **Foo View**: Evaluates and displays the result of a simple arithmetic expression.
